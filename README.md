# Machine-Learning-Model - Phase 1

The aim of this project is to investigate the reason behind discontinuing customers of a telecommunications company [1]. 
The dataset was obtained from the sample datasets provided in IBM Watson Analytics Community blog at:
https://community.watsonanalytics.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv.
The dataset provides the customer demographics, opted services and account preferences of a telecommunications company [2].
The project has two phases. Phase 1 focuses on data preprocessing and exploration, as covered in this report. 
Overall, the results indicate that customers who churn have noteworthy similarity in some features such as tenure, monthly charges, type of internet service 
and payment method preference. 
Further analysis will be conducted in Phase 2, using Machine Learning models on customer attributes to classify customers who are more likely to churn. 
This would help in developing focused customer retention programs.


# Machine-Learning-Model - Phase 2

The dataset provides the customer demographics, opted services and account preferences of a telecommunications company [2]. 
The project has two phases. Phase 1 focused on data preprocessing and exploration. 
Phase 2 focuses on using Machine Learning models on customer attributes to classify customers who are more likely to churn. 
This would help in developing focused customer retention programs.
The target feature is churn, which is a binary variable that describes whether a customer churned or not. 
There are nineteen descriptive features and one customer ID feature, which is a unique identifier of each customer. 
The dataset has 7043 rows, each describing a different customer. Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes and Decision Tree classifiers were built to predict the binary target (churn).
